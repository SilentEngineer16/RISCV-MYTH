# RISC-V MYTH Workshop – My Learning Journey

This repository documents my work from the RISC-V MYTH (Microprocessor for You in Thirty Hours) workshop conducted by VLSI System Design (VSD) and Redwood EDA.

Through this program, I gained hands-on experience in:

- **RISC-V ISA Fundamentals** – Understanding the RV32I instruction set and how software instructions map to hardware execution.  
- **TL-Verilog** – Learning a modern, timing-abstract HDL that simplifies pipeline implementation and reduces boilerplate code.  
- **CPU Design from Scratch** – Step-by-step creation of a working RISC-V core from basic modules to a fully integrated processor.  
- **Instruction Fetch, Decode, Execute** – Implementing the core stages of the pipeline and ensuring smooth instruction flow.  
- **Register File & ALU Design** – Creating the datapath elements that perform arithmetic, logic, and register operations.  
- **Load/Store Operations** – Designing memory access logic and understanding data alignment in the pipeline.  
- **Branch & Jump Handling** – Managing control hazards, branch prediction concepts, and program counter updates.  
- **Advanced Pipelining Concepts** – Implementing multi-stage pipelines, handling data/control hazards, and optimizing performance.  
- **Integration & Verification** – Combining all CPU components, running test programs, and debugging using waveform analysis.  
- **Makerchip Simulation** – Visualizing CPU behavior, analyzing timing, and validating instruction execution.  

This workshop deepened my understanding of processor architecture, hardware description languages, and computer organization — while giving me practical skills to design, simulate, and analyze a RISC-V CPU using modern tools.
